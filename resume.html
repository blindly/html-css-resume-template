<section class="coverletter" id="coverletter">
<p>Dear Company,</p>
<p>Look again at that dot. That's here. That's home. That's us. On it
everyone you love, everyone you know, everyone you ever heard of,
every human being who ever was, lived out their lives.
The aggregate of our joy and suffering, thousands of confident
religions, ideologies, and economic doctrines, every hunter and
forager, every hero and coward, every creator and destroyer of
civilization, every king and peasant, every young couple in love,
every mother and father, hopeful child, inventor and explorer,
every teacher of morals, every corrupt politician,
every "superstar," every "supreme leader," every saint and
sinner in the history of our species lived there--on a mote
of dust suspended in a sunbeam.</p>

<p>First, I believe that this nation should commit itself to
achieving the goal, before this decade is out, of landing
a man on the moon and returning him safely to the earth.
No single space project in this period will be more
impressive to mankind, or more important for the long-range
exploration of space; and none will be so difficult or
expensive to accomplish.</p>

<p>The Earth is a very small stage in a vast cosmic arena. Think of
the rivers of blood spilled by all those generals and emperors so
that, in glory and triumph, they could become the momentary masters
of a fraction of a dot. Think of the endless cruelties visited by
the inhabitants of one corner of this pixel on the scarcely
distinguishable inhabitants of some other corner, how frequent
their misunderstandings, how eager they are to kill one another,
how fervent their hatreds.</p>

<p>We choose to go to the moon. We choose to go to the moon in this
decade and do the other things, not because they are easy, but
because they are hard, because that goal will serve to organize and
measure the best of our energies and skills, because that challenge
is one that we are willing to accept, one we are unwilling to
postpone, and one which we intend to win, and the others, too.</p>

<p>The surface is fine and powdery. I can kick it up loosely with my
toe. It does adhere in fine layers, like powdered charcoal, to the
sole and sides of my boots. I only go in a small fraction of an
inch, maybe an eighth of an inch, but I can see the footprints of
my boots and the treads in the fine, sandy particles. There seems
to be no difficult in moving around, as we suspected.</p>

<p>The view of the Earth from the Moon fascinated me-a small disk,
240,000 miles away. It was hard to think that that little thing
held so many problems, so many frustrations.
Raging nationalistic interests, famines, wars,
pestilence don't show from that distance.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>First M. Last</p>
